## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file

Copy the following into your `.env` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SECRET="super-secret-token"
```

Your NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SECRET key can be anything you want. During development, I have used "super-secret-token" (very secure, i know)

### Dependency Warnings

You may see warnings like the following when running `npm install`:

```bash
npm WARN deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported...
npm WARN deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
```
These warnings are from indirect dependencies of jest and cannot be resolved until its upstream packages are updated. They do not affect functionality, and it is safe to proceed with installation and development.
